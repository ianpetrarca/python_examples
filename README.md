# Python Examples

Short coding snippets with comments to learn and explore the Python programming language. These examples were compiled for Ian Petrarca's PACE CIS101 class in 2019.

## Getting Started

These examples can be run on a local-machine if the Python interpreter has been installed. They can also be copied into an online IDE like Trinket, Sololearn and Code Academey. I reccomend using Visual Studio Code or the sublime text-editor.

### Installing and Editing Python
To install Python on your local machine, please download the Python3 interpreter.
